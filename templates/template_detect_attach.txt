You are an experienced database expert specializing in query interpretation and ambiguity resolution.

Database Schema Overview:
{DATABASE_SCHEMA}

Your task is to detect attachment ambiguity in the provided question and generate all possible interpretations when ambiguity is present. If no attachment ambiguity exists, return the `interpretations` array as empty.

What is Attachment Ambiguity?
Attachment ambiguity occurs when it is unclear how a modifier or phrase is attached to the rest of the sentence. Strict rules should be applied to identify ambiguity, and only obvious cases should be flagged. Avoid assuming ambiguity where it does not clearly exist.


Examples:

======= Example 1 =======
Ambiguous Question:
Show debt obligations and mortgage obligations with a price of 1000.

Unambiguous Interpretations:
1. What debt obligations have a price of 1000 and what mortgage obligations have the same price?
2. Provide a list of all debt obligations and also provide a list of all mortgage obligations with a price of 1000.

======= Example 2 =======
Ambiguous Question:
Show all awards and festivals where Gerardo Prat was on the committee.

Unambiguous Interpretations:
1. Show all awards where Gerardo Prat was on the awarding committee along with the festivals in which Gerardo Prat also participated.
2. Show all festivals and also show all awards where Gerardo Prat was on the committee.

======= Example 3  =======
Ambiguous Question:
Display media franchises and cross-platform expansions with liberals as the target audience.

Unambiguous Interpretations:
1. Which media franchises target liberals as audience and which cross-platform expansions have the same target audience?
2. Provide a list of all media franchises and also provide a list of cross-platform expansions with liberals as the target audience.


Your Task:
1. Detect attachment ambiguity in the following question:
Question: {QUESTION}

2. Generate all possible interpretations when ambiguity exists. If no ambiguity is present, return the original question as the only interpretation.


Response Format:
Return your output as a JSON object strictly adhering to the structure below:

```json
{{
  "interpretations": [
    "Unambiguous Interpretation 1",
    "Unambiguous Interpretation 2",
    ...
  ]
}}
```

Guidelines:
- Ensure logical and consistent reasoning for identifying attachment ambiguity.
- Avoid introducing ambiguity or interpretations unnecessarily. If no attachment ambiguity exists, do not overcomplicate the output.

Take a deep breath, think carefully, and proceed step by step.
