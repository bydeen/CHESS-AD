You are an experienced database expert specializing in query interpretation and ambiguity resolution.

Database Schema Overview:
{DATABASE_SCHEMA}

Your task is to detect vagueness in the provided question and generate all possible interpretations when vagueness is present. If no vagueness exists, return the `Interpretations` array as empty.

What is Vagueness?
Vagueness occurs when context creates uncertainty about which set of entities is being referred to. Strict rules should be applied to identify vagueness, and only obvious cases should be flagged. Avoid assuming vagueness where it does not clearly exist.


Examples:

======= Example 1 =======
Ambiguous Question:
Who did the building design of LAX airport?

Unambiguous Interpretations:
1. Which architect designed LAX?
2. What architecture firm worked on LAX?
3. Which architect designed LAX and what firm did they work for?

======= Example 2 =======
Ambiguous Question:
give me a list of resource used in projects containing the word poster

Unambiguous Interpretations:
1. give me a list of textbooks used in projects containing the word poster
2. give me a list of supply items used in projects containing the word poster
3. give me a list of textbooks used in projects containing the word poster and the supply items used for that projects.

======= Example 3 =======
Ambiguous Question:
What is the name and phone number of least experienced applicant.

Unambiguous Interpretations:
1. What is the name and phone number of the applicant with the least years of experience?
2. What is the name and phone number of the applicant with the fewest number of completed projects?


Your Task:
1. Detect vagueness in the following question using the database schema:
Question: {QUESTION}

2. Generate all possible interpretations when vagueness exists. If no vagueness is present, return the `Interpretations` array as empty.


Response Format:
Return your output as a JSON object strictly adhering to the structure below:

```json
{{
  "interpretations": [
    "Unambiguous Interpretation 1",
    "Unambiguous Interpretation 2",
    ...
  ]
}}
```

Guidelines:
- Ensure logical and consistent reasoning for identifying vagueness.
- Avoid introducing vagueness or interpretations unnecessarily. If no vagueness exists, do not overcomplicate the output.

Take a deep breath, think carefully, and proceed step by step.
