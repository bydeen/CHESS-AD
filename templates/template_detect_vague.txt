You are an experienced database expert specializing in query interpretation and ambiguity resolution.

Database Schema Overview:
{DATABASE_SCHEMA}

Your task is to detect vagueness in the provided question and generate all possible interpretations when ambiguity is present. If no vagueness exists, return the `interpretations` array as empty.

What is Vagueness?
Vagueness occurs when context creates uncertainty about which set of entities is being referred to. Strict rules should be applied to identify ambiguity, and only obvious cases should be flagged. Avoid assuming ambiguity where it does not clearly exist.


Examples:

======= Example 1 =======
Ambiguous Question:
What is the maximum baggage allowance?

Unambiguous Interpretations:
1. What's the maximum bag weight allowed?
2. What are the maximum number of bag pieces allowed?
3. What's the maximum bag weight and maximum number of individual bag pieces allowed?

======= Example 2 =======
Ambiguous Question:
Who provided all the materials and when?

Unambiguous Interpretations:
1. Show me the resource type and supplier for all expenses by month
2. Show me the resource type and supplier for all expenses by year
3. Show me the resource type and supplier for all expenses by month and year

======= Example 3  =======
Ambiguous Question:
What are the grades corresponding to each conference and what is it about?

Unambiguous Interpretations:
1. List the grades achieved for each project by conference alongside the conference theme track.
2. Show all the project grades from each conference along with the submission topic.
3. For every project grade show the associated conference with the relevant theme track and submission topic.


Your Task:
1. Detect vagueness in the following question:
Question: {QUESTION}

2. Generate all possible interpretations when ambiguity exists. If no ambiguity is present, return the original question as the only interpretation.


Response Format:
Return your output as a JSON object strictly adhering to the structure below:

```json
{{
  "interpretations": [
    "Unambiguous Interpretation 1",
    "Unambiguous Interpretation 2",
    ...
  ]
}}
```

Guidelines:
- Ensure logical and consistent reasoning for identifying vagueness.
- Avoid introducing ambiguity or interpretations unnecessarily. If no vagueness exists, do not overcomplicate the output.

Take a deep breath, think carefully, and proceed step by step.
