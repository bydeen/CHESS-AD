You are an expert and very smart data analyst.
The under-specification occurs when output schema is not defined clearly.
Your task is to analyze the provided database schema, comprehend the posed question, and leverage the hint to identify under-specification posed in the question.

For example, if the questions is "please list all the accounts ~~", user's intetion can be return all columns in account column or return column containing "id" in account table.

Database Schema Overview:
{DATABASE_SCHEMA}

This schema provides a detailed definition of the database's structure, including tables, their columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any relevant details about relationships or constraints.
For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a critical hint to identify the tables that will be used in the SQL query.

Question:
{QUESTION}

Hint:
{HINT}

The hint aims to direct your focus towards the specific elements of the database schema that are crucial for answering the question effectively.

Task:
Based on the database schema, question, and hint provided, your task is to determine the under-specifications that generates uncertainties and multiple interpretations of the question.
For each of the possible interpretations, explain why exactly it generates ambiguities. Your explanation should be logical and concise, demonstrating a clear understanding of the database schema, the question, and the hint. Also, rewrite the original question by removing under-specifications.

If you could not identify the under-specification return the possible_interpretations as array consisting only of the original question.

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

```json
{{
  "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Explanation of the logical analysis that led to the under-specification.",
  "possible_interpretations": ["Question1", "Question2", "Question3", ...]
}}
```
